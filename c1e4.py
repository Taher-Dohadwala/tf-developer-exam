"""
Below is code with a link to a happy or sad dataset which contains 80 images, 40 happy and 40 sad.
Create a convolutional neural network that trains to 100% accuracy on these images,  which cancels training upon hitting training accuracy of >.999

Hint -- it will work best with 3 convolutional layers.+
